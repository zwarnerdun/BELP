# BELP Happy Hour Finder

## Let BELP help you discover your best Happy Hour

Our application allows the user to either view a list of happy hours with time, location, price rating and over-all rating values or enter a happy hour of their choice into the database with these values. You can navigate to either page from the home page and navigate bach to the home page from either route. We used Google Maps to show the user a map of the Philadelphia area.

We created a post.test to check to make sure the database was receiving the intended object with proper values and saving it to the database. Zhane added chalk to customize the terminal experience.

Further improvements would to allow a city value in the database so that we could create a dropdown menu listing all cities that exist in our database. We would like for the locations in our database to populate on the map with markers. We would like to allow users to give their own over-all rating choice and allow that value to display as an average of all user votes. We need to include a few validation for data input and also to check for multiple entries of the same location.

All members of our team contributed equally. We all took on specific tasks as well as assisting each other when problems arose.
